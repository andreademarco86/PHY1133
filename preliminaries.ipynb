    "# Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course we will be using the Python programming language. Python \n",
    "is a great general-purpose programming language on its own, but with the help of a few popular libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib) it becomes a powerful environment for scientific computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Course overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The following lists the overview for this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 ECTS Credits\n",
    "- 100% Assignment\n",
    "- 2hr lab sessions\n",
    "- Course material will be provided\n",
    "- For labs there is no need to buy any books, there are plenty of resources online\n",
    "- You are encouraged to bring your laptop with you and work on the course material in class\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have any questions you can contact me on andrea.demarco@um.edu.mt. You can also come to my office with any questions: Room 204, Maths and Physics building. It is advised to send an email to book a slot to make sure that I will be available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why bother to learn programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming is becoming a necessity in most of the sciences. We'll stick to physical problems in this course. Traditional analytical tools have certain limitations, since although they have enabled us to solve an incredible range of problems, they are mostly restricted to linear systems. And the vast majority of outstanding problems are inherently non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, spurred by the rising cost of experimentation, computational physics is used to conduct \"experiments\" in the virtual world through simulations. Modern experiments and instruments also tend to generate a lot of data which cannot be processed by hand, so software is required to aid the scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational physics serves as a critical role at the interface between experimental and theoretical physics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a computer?\n",
    "\n",
    "What is a computer? There are various definitions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A programmable machine that receives input, stores and manipulates data, and provides output in a useful format\n",
    "- a machine for performing calculations automatically\n",
    "- the most useful and most frustrating thing any human being will ever work with\n",
    "- a very, very expensive punching bag\n",
    "\n",
    "A definition more applicable to us:\n",
    "A set of devices which work **under the control of a stored program**, **automatically** accepting and **processing data** to produce information\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Some definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers carry out instructions, a set of which is called a **program**. It tells the computer's control unit what to do\n",
    "- A program is written using a **computer** (or **programming**) **language**\n",
    "- **Software** is the general term to describe all the programs and data used in computer systems\n",
    "- **Hardware** is the collective term used to refer to the series of devices making up a computer\n",
    "- **Programming** is the art/science/magic of writing software. Programs are usually written as text files. **Code** is the textual representation of programs\n",
    "- A **compiler** transforms these text files into a form which the CPU can understand and **execute**\n",
    "- An **interpreter** does not transform the entire text files, but goes through your code line by line as it is being executed and only transforms the lines which are currently being executed\n",
    "- When a program behaves incorrectly, it is said to have a **bug**. **Debugging** is the act of removing bugs from a program\n",
    "\n",
    "For a high-level introduction of how computers work, have a look at [these slides](introduction_computer_systems.pptx)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Course Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "A [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/andreademarco86/phy1133/main?urlpath=tree/index.ipynb) to these course notes will be provided on VLE. Note that there are plenty of other notebooks available for viewing here, so feel free to have a look around.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Online Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "Primarily we'll be using the online Python interpreter [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).\n",
